<h1><strong> I'm one of the senditive people that's easy to get hurt even the small thin.Bieng a sensitive person doesn't mean that you're crying in the corner over nothing.It means to be aware of your emotion and being in touch with them, and being sensitive is not bad nothing like some people think. It just means that you are awware, which is great.Every person has a sensitivity side.
